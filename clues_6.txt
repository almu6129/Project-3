There are a pair of shoes laying in the middle of the room
There are muddy foot prints in the carpet
There is a half eaten hot dog laying out
There is a faint smell of metal in the room.
The walls are red
There is a secret peep hole to the next room in the wall
There is an annoying dog barking beyond the wall
