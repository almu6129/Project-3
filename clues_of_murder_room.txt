There is an odd smell that you can't place
The walls are red
The room feels cold
There is a weird star on the walls
The window is cracked
There is a hole in the drywall
There are unusual indentations in the carpet 
There is a board game still out on the table
The room is humid
You find a hidden safe in the room that is unlocked
There is a pair of shoes scattered about
There are muddy foot prints in the carpet
There is a tear in the painting on the wall
There is a half eaten hot dog laying out
